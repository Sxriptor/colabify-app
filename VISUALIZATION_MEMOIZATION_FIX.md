# Visualization Components Memoization Fix

## Problem
The D3.js visualization components (CommitBubbles, BranchTimeline, ContributorGraph) were re-rendering every 5 seconds even when no data changes occurred because:

1. **No memoization** - Components re-rendered on every parent update
2. **Object reference changes** - New props objects were created each time
3. **Expensive D3.js re-calculations** - Full SVG recreation on every render
4. **No data comparison** - Components couldn't detect if actual data changed

## Root Cause
Even though the data hash comparison was working at the hook level, the individual visualization components were still receiving new object references for the `commits` prop, causing them to re-run their expensive D3.js `useEffect` hooks.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. React.memo with Custom Comparison
- **Wrapped each component** with `React.memo` and custom comparison function
- **Deep comparison** of commit data (SHA, message, author, stats)
- **Prevents re-render** when data is functionally identical

### 2. Stable Data Representation
- **Added `useMemo`** to create stable data objects for comparison
- **Extracted only essential fields** for D3.js rendering
- **Consistent data structure** across re-renders

### 3. Optimized useEffect Dependencies
- **Changed from `[commits]`** to `[stableCommits]`
- **Stable references** prevent unnecessary D3.js re-calculations
- **Only triggers** when actual data content changes

## Changes Made

### CommitBubbles.tsx
```typescript
// Before
export function CommitBubbles({ commits }: CommitBubblesProps) {
  useEffect(() => {
    // Expensive D3.js operations
  }, [commits]) // Re-runs on every prop change
}

// After
function CommitBubblesComponent({ commits }: CommitBubblesProps) {
  const stableCommits = useMemo(() => {
    return commits.map(c => ({
      sha: c.sha,
      message: c.commit.message,
      author: c.commit.author.name,
      // ... only essential fields
    }))
  }, [commits])

  useEffect(() => {
    // Expensive D3.js operations
  }, [stableCommits]) // Only re-runs when data actually changes
}

export const CommitBubbles = memo(CommitBubblesComponent, customComparison)
```

### BranchTimeline.tsx
- Same pattern applied
- Custom comparison for timeline-specific data
- Stable date/author/stats comparison

### ContributorGraph.tsx
- Same pattern applied
- Custom comparison for contributor-specific data
- Stable author/contribution comparison

## Performance Benefits

### Before Fix
- ❌ Components re-rendered every 5 seconds
- ❌ Full D3.js SVG recreation each time
- ❌ Expensive calculations on identical data
- ❌ Visual flickering and performance issues

### After Fix
- ✅ Components only re-render when data actually changes
- ✅ D3.js operations skipped when data is identical
- ✅ Stable visual experience
- ✅ Significant performance improvement

## Expected Behavior Now

### When No Data Changes
- ✅ Visualization components remain completely stable
- ✅ No D3.js re-calculations or SVG updates
- ✅ No visual flickering or refreshing
- ✅ Console shows: "No data changes detected - skipping UI update"

### When Data Actually Changes
- ✅ Components detect the change through custom comparison
- ✅ D3.js visualizations update appropriately
- ✅ Smooth transitions and animations work correctly
- ✅ Only affected components re-render

## Custom Comparison Logic
Each component compares:
- **SHA values** - Unique commit identifiers
- **Messages** - Commit messages
- **Authors** - Author names and emails
- **Statistics** - Additions/deletions counts
- **Dates** - Commit timestamps (where relevant)

## Files Modified
- `src/components/projects/repovisual/local/CommitBubbles.tsx`
- `src/components/projects/repovisual/local/BranchTimeline.tsx`
- `src/components/projects/repovisual/local/ContributorGraph.tsx`

## Testing Verification
1. ✅ Visualizations no longer refresh every 5 seconds
2. ✅ Components only update when actual Git changes occur
3. ✅ D3.js animations and interactions work smoothly
4. ✅ No performance degradation or memory leaks
5. ✅ Custom comparison functions work correctly
