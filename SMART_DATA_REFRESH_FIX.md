# Smart Data Refresh Fix

## Problem
The repository visualization was refreshing the entire UI every time a Git event occurred (every ~5 seconds), causing:
- Unnecessary re-renders and performance issues
- Poor user experience with constant UI updates
- Wasted resources when no actual data changes occurred

## Solution
Implemented smart data comparison and background checking to only update the UI when data actually changes.

## Key Changes

### 1. Data Hash Comparison
- Added `createDataHash()` function to generate a hash of the current data state
- Only updates UI state when the data hash changes
- Tracks `lastDataHash` to compare against new data

### 2. Background Data Checking
- Added `checkForDataChanges()` function for non-intrusive background checks
- Background checks don't show loading states or disrupt the UI
- Only updates UI if actual data changes are detected

### 3. Debouncing
- Added 2-second debounce to prevent excessive background checks
- Tracks `lastCheckTime` to enforce minimum time between checks
- Prevents rapid-fire Git events from causing performance issues

### 4. Smart Git Event Handling
- Git events now trigger background checks instead of full refreshes
- UI only updates when meaningful changes are detected
- Maintains real-time responsiveness without unnecessary updates

## New Behavior

### Initial Load
- ✅ Shows loading state and fetches data normally
- ✅ Sets initial data hash for future comparisons

### Git Events (Background)
- ✅ Triggers background data check without loading state
- ✅ Compares new data hash with previous hash
- ✅ Only updates UI if data actually changed
- ✅ Logs whether changes were detected or skipped

### Debouncing
- ✅ Ignores Git events that occur within 2 seconds of each other
- ✅ Prevents excessive API calls and processing
- ✅ Maintains responsiveness for actual changes

## Console Output Examples

### No Changes Detected
```
🔍 Checking for data changes in background...
✅ No data changes detected - skipping UI update
```

### Changes Detected
```
🔍 Checking for data changes in background...
🔄 Data changed - updating UI
📊 All branches data: [...]
✅ Using real Git data from 1 stored repositories
```

### Debounced
```
🔍 Skipping background check - too soon since last check
```

## Performance Benefits
- **Reduced Re-renders**: UI only updates when data changes
- **Better UX**: No more constant refreshing/flickering
- **Resource Efficiency**: Background checks are lightweight
- **Responsive**: Still updates immediately when real changes occur

## Files Modified
- `src/components/projects/repovisual/hooks/useRepositoryData.ts`

## Testing
1. Open repository visualization
2. Make a Git change (commit, branch switch, etc.)
3. Verify UI updates only when actual changes occur
4. Check console for appropriate logging messages
5. Confirm no unnecessary refreshes happen
