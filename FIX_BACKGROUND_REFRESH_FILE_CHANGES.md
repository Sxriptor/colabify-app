# Fix: Background Refresh File Changes Not Syncing

## Problem

The `GitDataManager` was using cached data and not syncing file changes to the `live_file_changes` table during background refreshes. The logs showed:

```
‚úÖ [GitDataManager] electron-colabify cache is fresh, using cached data
```

File changes were detected but not being synced to the database.

## Root Cause

The `GitDataManager.refreshGitData()` method was:
1. Reading git state from Electron API ‚úÖ
2. Detecting uncommitted changes for UI display ‚úÖ
3. **BUT NOT** syncing the detailed file changes to the database ‚ùå

Even though the Electron backend (`git-monitoring-simple.js`) was enhanced to return `fileChanges` with statistics in the git state, the frontend wasn't using this data to update the database.

## Solution

### Changes Made to `src/services/GitDataManager.ts`

#### 1. Added File Change Syncing

After detecting uncommitted changes (lines 393-421), added code to sync file changes to database:

```typescript
// Sync file changes to database if there are uncommitted changes
if (uncommittedChanges.length > 0 && gitState.fileChanges) {
  try {
    await this.syncFileChangesToDatabase(
      projectId,
      userId || mapping.user_id,
      repo.id,
      gitState.fileChanges
    )
    console.log(`üíæ [GitDataManager] Synced ${gitState.fileChanges.length} file changes for ${repo.name}`)
  } catch (syncError) {
    console.error(`‚ùå [GitDataManager] Failed to sync file changes:`, syncError)
  }
}
```

#### 2. Added `syncFileChangesToDatabase()` Method

New private method that:
- Accepts project, user, repository IDs and file changes array
- Creates a session ID for tracking
- Formats file changes for the API
- Calls the `/api/live-activities/file-changes` endpoint
- Handles errors gracefully

```typescript
private async syncFileChangesToDatabase(
  projectId: string,
  userId: string,
  repositoryId: string,
  fileChanges: Array<{...}>
): Promise<void>
```

## How It Works Now

### Background Refresh Flow

```
1. Timer triggers every 5 minutes (or manual refresh)
   ‚Üì
2. GitDataManager.refreshGitData() called
   ‚Üì
3. Electron API returns git state WITH fileChanges array
   ‚Üì
4. Parse uncommitted changes (for UI display)
   ‚Üì
5. IF uncommitted changes exist AND fileChanges exist:
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚Üí Call syncFileChangesToDatabase()
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚Üí Format file changes for API
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚Üí POST to /api/live-activities/file-changes
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚Üí Database updated
   ‚Üì
6. Continue with normal cache update
```

### What Gets Synced

For each file change detected during background refresh:
- File path
- Change type (MODIFIED, ADDED, DELETED, RENAMED)
- Lines added (from `git diff --numstat`)
- Lines removed (from `git diff --numstat`)
- File type (extension)
- Timestamps

## Logs You'll Now See

### Before Fix
```
‚úÖ [GitDataManager] electron-colabify cache is fresh, using cached data
```

### After Fix
```
‚úÖ [GitDataManager] electron-colabify cache is fresh, using cached data
üíæ [GitDataManager] Synced 3 file changes for electron-colabify
‚úÖ [GitDataManager] File changes synced: { success: true, message: 'Synced 3 file changes' }
```

## Benefits

1. **Always Up-to-Date**: File changes are now synced even when using cached commit history
2. **Dual Coverage**: Both real-time monitoring AND background refresh sync file changes
3. **No Data Loss**: File changes aren't missed during cache-fresh periods
4. **Better Performance**: Syncing happens efficiently during existing background refresh

## Testing

To verify the fix works:

1. **Make file changes** in your repository
2. **Wait for background refresh** (5 minutes) or trigger manually
3. **Check console logs** for sync messages
4. **Query database**:
   ```sql
   SELECT 
     file_path,
     change_type,
     lines_added,
     lines_removed,
     last_change_at
   FROM live_file_changes 
   WHERE project_id = 'your-project-id'
   ORDER BY last_change_at DESC
   LIMIT 10;
   ```

## Files Modified

- `src/services/GitDataManager.ts` - Added file change syncing to background refresh

## Related Documentation

- `GIT_FILE_CHANGES_TRACKING_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Complete implementation details
- `GIT_FILE_CHANGES_SUMMARY.md` - Quick reference guide

## Migration Notes

No database migrations needed. Uses existing:
- `live_file_changes` table
- `/api/live-activities/file-changes` endpoint
- Electron `readDirectGitState` API (already returns fileChanges)

Everything works out of the box! üéâ
