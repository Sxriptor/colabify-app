# Fix: Inbox Not Showing Invitations (RLS Policy Issue)

## Problem Summary

Users who were invited to projects could not see their invitations in the Electron app inbox, even though:
- The invitation existed in the `project_invitations` table
- They were added as `pending` members in `project_members`
- The inbox query was running without errors

Additionally, when invitations were returned, the app crashed with:
```
Cannot read properties of null (reading 'name')
at InboxContent.tsx:219
```

## Root Cause

The issue was caused by **missing Row Level Security (RLS) policies** on four tables:

### 1. `project_invitations` Table
The original RLS policies only allowed:
- ✅ Project owners to view invitations for their projects
- ❌ **Invited users could NOT view invitations sent to their email**

This meant that when an invited user queried `project_invitations` filtered by their email, the RLS policies blocked the results.

### 2. `projects` Table  
The RLS policies only allowed users to view:
- ✅ Projects they own
- ✅ Projects they are members of
- ❌ **Projects they have been invited to**

When the inbox tried to fetch invitation details with a join like:
```sql
project:projects(id, name, description, visibility)
```

The `project` field would return `null` because the invited user didn't have permission to view that project, causing the crash.

### 3. `users` Table
The RLS policies only allowed:
- ✅ Users to view their own profile
- ❌ **Users could NOT view other users' profiles (like project owners or members)**

When queries tried to fetch owner information with:
```sql
owner:users!projects_owner_id_fkey(id, name, email, avatar_url)
```

The `owner` field would return `null`, causing "Cannot read properties of null" errors in components.

### 4. `project_members` Table
The INSERT policy only allowed:
- ✅ Project owners to add members
- ❌ **Invited users could NOT add themselves when accepting invitations**

When trying to accept an invitation:
```typescript
await supabase.from('project_members').insert({ project_id, user_id, role: 'member' })
```

The query would fail with `403 Forbidden` because the invited user is not the project owner.

## Solution

The fix involves updating RLS policies on all four tables to allow invited users appropriate access.

### Changes Made

1. **Updated `project_invitations` RLS policies**:
   - Allow invited users to **SELECT** invitations sent to their email
   - Allow invited users to **UPDATE** invitations (to accept/decline)

2. **Added new `projects` RLS policy**:
   - Allow users to view basic information about projects they have pending invitations for

3. **Updated `project_members` INSERT policy**:
   - Allow invited users to insert themselves when accepting invitations
   - Still allows project owners to add any member

4. **Added defensive error handling** in components:
   - Skip rendering invitations with missing data in `InboxContent.tsx`
   - Safe null handling for owner data in `ProjectCard.tsx`
   - Log errors to console for debugging

### Files Modified

- ✅ `database/migrations/fix_invitation_rls_policies.sql` - New migration with RLS fixes (4 tables)
- ✅ `database/migrations/fix_invitation_rls_policies_cleanup.sql` - Cleanup script
- ✅ `src/components/inbox/InboxContent.tsx` - Added null safety checks
- ✅ `src/components/projects/ProjectCard.tsx` - Added null safety checks

## How to Apply the Fix

### Option 1: Using Supabase Dashboard (Recommended)

**If you already tried the migration and got a 500 error:**
1. First, run `database/migrations/fix_invitation_rls_policies_cleanup.sql` to clean up
2. Then proceed with the steps below

**Fresh installation or after cleanup:**
1. Open your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to **SQL Editor** in the left sidebar
3. Create a new query
4. Copy the contents of `database/migrations/fix_invitation_rls_policies.sql`
5. Paste into the editor
6. Click **Run** to execute the migration
7. Verify success (you should see "Success. No rows returned")

### Option 2: Using Supabase CLI

If you have the Supabase CLI configured:

```bash
# Connect to your Supabase project
supabase link --project-ref YOUR_PROJECT_REF

# Run the migration
supabase db push database/migrations/fix_invitation_rls_policies.sql
```

### Option 3: Manual SQL Execution

Connect to your Supabase database via any PostgreSQL client and execute the SQL file.

## What the Migration Does

### 1. Updates `project_invitations` Policies

**Before:**
```sql
-- Only project owners could see invitations
CREATE POLICY "Project owners can view invitations for their projects" 
ON project_invitations FOR SELECT USING (
    project_id IN (SELECT id FROM projects WHERE owner_id = auth.uid())
);
```

**After:**
```sql
-- Both project owners AND invited users can see invitations
CREATE POLICY "Users can view invitations for their projects or sent to their email" 
ON project_invitations FOR SELECT USING (
    project_id IN (SELECT id FROM projects WHERE owner_id = auth.uid())
    OR
    email IN (SELECT email FROM users WHERE id = auth.uid())
);
```

### 2. Adds Helper Function to Avoid Circular Dependencies

```sql
-- Helper function that bypasses RLS to prevent circular dependency
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION has_pending_invitation(project_uuid UUID, user_uuid UUID)
RETURNS BOOLEAN
LANGUAGE sql
SECURITY DEFINER
STABLE
AS $$
  SELECT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM project_invitations pi
    JOIN users u ON pi.email = u.email
    WHERE pi.project_id = project_uuid 
    AND u.id = user_uuid
    AND pi.status = 'pending'
  );
$$;
```

**Why a helper function?** Without it, we'd get a circular RLS dependency:
- Projects policy checks project_invitations → triggers RLS on project_invitations
- Project_invitations query joins projects → triggers RLS on projects
- This creates an infinite loop causing 500 errors

The `SECURITY DEFINER` function bypasses RLS, breaking the cycle.

### 3. Adds New `users` Policy to View Project-Related Users

```sql
-- Allow viewing user info for people in projects you have access to
CREATE POLICY "Users can view other users in accessible projects" 
ON users FOR SELECT USING (
    id = auth.uid()  -- Own profile
    OR
    id IN (SELECT p.owner_id FROM projects p WHERE has_pending_invitation(p.id, auth.uid()))  -- Owners of projects you're invited to
    OR
    id IN (SELECT p.owner_id FROM projects p JOIN project_members pm ON pm.project_id = p.id WHERE pm.user_id = auth.uid())  -- Owners of projects you're in
    OR
    id IN (SELECT pm.user_id FROM project_members pm WHERE pm.project_id IN (...))  -- Other members
);
```

This allows you to see avatar, name, and email of:
- Project owners for projects you're invited to or member of
- Other members in projects you're part of

### 4. Adds New `projects` Policy Using the Helper

```sql
-- Allow users to view projects they've been invited to
CREATE POLICY "Users can view projects they are invited to" 
ON projects FOR SELECT USING (
    has_pending_invitation(id, auth.uid())
);
```

### 5. Updates `project_members` INSERT Policy

```sql
-- Allow project owners AND invited users to insert members
CREATE POLICY "project_members_insert" ON project_members
    FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (
        is_project_owner(project_id, auth.uid())  -- Owners can add anyone
        OR
        (user_id = auth.uid() AND has_pending_invitation(project_id, auth.uid()))  -- Invited users can add themselves
    );
```

This is crucial for the "Accept" button to work - invited users need permission to add themselves as active members.

## Verification Steps

After applying the migration:

1. **Test as an invited user:**
   - Log into the Electron app with an account that has a pending invitation
   - Navigate to the Inbox
   - You should now see your pending invitation(s) with full project details

2. **Test accepting an invitation:**
   - Click "Accept" on an invitation
   - Verify you're redirected to the project page
   - Confirm you now appear in the project members list with "active" status

3. **Test declining an invitation:**
   - Click "Decline" on an invitation
   - Verify the invitation disappears from your inbox
   - Confirm the invitation status is updated to "declined" in the database

## Technical Details

### Query Flow

When an invited user loads their inbox, the following happens:

1. **Query execution** (from `InboxContent.tsx`):
```typescript
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from('project_invitations')
  .select(`
    id, project_id, email, invited_by, status, expires_at, created_at,
    project:projects(id, name, description, visibility),
    inviter:users!project_invitations_invited_by_fkey(name, email)
  `)
  .eq('email', user?.email)
  .eq('status', 'pending')
```

2. **RLS policy evaluation:**
   - ✅ `project_invitations` policy checks if user's email matches invitation email
   - ✅ `projects` policy checks if user has pending invitation for the project
   - ✅ `users` policy allows viewing inviter details (already existed)

3. **Result:**
   - All three joins succeed and return complete data
   - UI renders properly with no null reference errors

### Security Considerations

The new policies maintain security by:
- Only showing invitation data to the specific email recipient
- Only showing project data when there's a valid pending invitation
- Not exposing sensitive project data beyond basic info (name, description, visibility)
- Still requiring proper authentication (auth.uid() checks)

## Rollback (if needed)

If you need to rollback these changes:

```sql
-- Remove the helper function first (it's used by policies)
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS has_pending_invitation(UUID, UUID);

-- Remove the new policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view invitations for their projects or sent to their email" ON project_invitations;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update invitations for their projects or sent to them" ON project_invitations;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view other users in accessible projects" ON users;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view projects they are invited to" ON projects;

-- Restore original policies
CREATE POLICY "Project owners can view invitations for their projects" ON project_invitations
    FOR SELECT USING (
        project_id IN (SELECT id FROM projects WHERE owner_id = auth.uid())
    );

CREATE POLICY "Project owners can update invitations" ON project_invitations
    FOR UPDATE USING (
        project_id IN (SELECT id FROM projects WHERE owner_id = auth.uid())
    );

CREATE POLICY "Users can view own profile" ON users
    FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = id);
```

## Additional Notes

- The fix is **backwards compatible** - it only adds permissions, doesn't remove any
- Project owners retain all their existing permissions
- The defensive null checks in `InboxContent.tsx` prevent future crashes even if RLS policies have issues
- No application code changes are needed beyond the defensive error handling already applied
