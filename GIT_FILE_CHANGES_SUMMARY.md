# Git File Changes Tracking - Quick Summary

## What Was Fixed

The git scanning system now properly detects file changes and inserts/updates them in the `live_file_changes` database table.

## Files Modified

### 1. **ActivityDetector.ts**
Added `detectFileChanges()` method that:
- Parses git status to find changed files
- Determines change type (MODIFIED, ADDED, DELETED, RENAMED)
- Gets diff statistics (lines added/removed) for each file

### 2. **DatabaseSync.ts**
Updated `syncFileChanges()` to:
- Accept userId and projectId parameters
- Make actual API calls to Supabase
- Use proper upsert behavior

### 3. **GitMonitoringBackend.ts**
Added `detectAndSyncFileChanges()` that:
- Automatically triggers on WORKTREE_CHANGE and COMMIT activities
- Detects file changes using ActivityDetector
- Syncs to database via DatabaseSync

### 4. **LiveActivityMonitor.ts**
Updated periodic sync to:
- Sync file changes every 60 seconds
- Pass proper session context to database sync

### 5. **git-monitoring-simple.js** (Electron)
Enhanced to:
- Include file changes in git state
- Added `detectFileChanges()` method
- Returns file change data with statistics

### 6. **New API Endpoint**
Created `src/app/api/live-activities/file-changes/route.ts`:
- POST: Sync file changes to database
- GET: Retrieve file changes for session/project

## How It Works

```
File Changed ‚Üí Git Status Updated ‚Üí Activity Detector Triggered
     ‚Üì
Parse Git Status ‚Üí Extract File Paths ‚Üí Get Diff Stats
     ‚Üì
Create File Change Records ‚Üí Sync to Database ‚Üí Update live_file_changes Table
```

## What Data Is Tracked

For each changed file:
- **File path** - Relative path in repository
- **Change type** - MODIFIED, ADDED, DELETED, or RENAMED
- **Lines added** - Number of lines added
- **Lines removed** - Number of lines deleted
- **File type** - File extension
- **Timestamps** - First and last change times
- **Session context** - User, project, session IDs

## Testing

1. Start git monitoring on a project
2. Make changes to files
3. Check logs for "üìÅ Detected X file changes"
4. Query database:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM live_file_changes 
   WHERE project_id = 'your-project-id'
   ORDER BY last_change_at DESC
   LIMIT 10;
   ```

## Key Features

‚úÖ Automatic detection when files change
‚úÖ Detailed statistics (lines added/removed)
‚úÖ Supports all git change types
‚úÖ Batched syncing (every 60 seconds)
‚úÖ Proper error handling
‚úÖ User authentication and authorization
‚úÖ Works in both TypeScript backend and Electron

## Next Steps

The system is now ready to:
- Track all file changes during development
- Display file changes in UI
- Generate activity timelines
- Show team collaboration insights
- Calculate contribution metrics
